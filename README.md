Housing remains one of the most critical sectors for economic growth, investment, and social stability, and this project sought to illuminate the evolving dynamics of the Nigerian residential property market using a rich dataset of over 24,000 property listings from across the country. The result is an insightful and data-driven narrative, culminating in an interactive Power BI dashboard designed for real estate professionals, investors, and policy stakeholders.

## Pre-Analysis Narrative: Understanding the Landscape

The dataset tells a compelling story about residential housing patterns in Nigeria, capturing properties from various towns and states, along with vital features such as

Title: Property type (e.g., Detached Duplex, Bungalow)

Location: Town and State

Quantitative Features: Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Toilets, Parking spaces

Price: In Nigerian Naira

## Analysis Breakdown: Insights that Matter
After slicing and analyzing the data, several key insights emerged:

### 1. Price Variation by State

Lagos and Abuja top the charts with the highest average prices across all house types.
Most listings fall within the ₦20M–₦200M range, though ultra-premium listings exceed ₦500M.

### 2. Listing Volume

Lagos leads in total number of listings, followed by Abuja and Ogun State.

### 3. Popular Property Types

Detached duplexes, terraced duplexes, and semi-detached duplexes dominate, especially in urban areas.
These titles account for the majority of higher-priced listings.

### 4. Bedrooms vs Price

Properties with 4–6 bedrooms are the most common and typically occupy the mid-to-high price tiers.
While a larger bedroom count tends to raise the price, location exerts a stronger influence.

### 5. Luxury Features
Premium listings (especially in Lagos and Abuja) often feature multiple bathrooms and generous parking space, underscoring lifestyle-driven pricing.

## Lagos-Specific Highlights
To gain a deeper understanding of the Nigerian housing market, I took a focused look at Lagos State, which unsurprisingly holds the highest number of property listings in the dataset. The findings reveal a dynamic and diverse market with a concentration of premium properties, especially in areas like Lekki, Ikoyi, and Ajah.

One standout trend is the dominance of detached duplexes. With a staggering 11,802 listings, detached duplexes are by far the most common property type in Lagos. These homes typically offer five bedrooms, five bathrooms, and six toilets, clearly catering to buyers in the upper income bracket. The average listing price for a detached duplex in Lagos sits at an impressive ₦428 million, making them a flagship offering in the high-end segment.

Next in line are semi-detached duplexes, which recorded 2,100 listings. These properties generally come with four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and five toilets and command an average price of around ₦398 million. They offer a slightly more affordable alternative to fully detached homes while still maintaining a premium feel.

Blocks of flats also make a strong appearance with 1,050 listings. On average, these properties feature three bedrooms, four bathrooms, and four toilets, with an average price point of approximately ₦215 million. This category likely appeals to both families and investors looking for multi-unit income-generating properties.

Meanwhile, detached bungalows and semi-detached bungalows show more modest numbers. Detached bungalows accounted for 1,052 listings, averaging three bedrooms, four bathrooms, and four toilets, with an average price of ₦53 million. Semi-detached bungalows were fewer, at 243 listings, and typically include three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and four toilets, with an average market value of ₦44 million. These listings represent more budget-conscious housing options.

Lastly, Terraced Bungalows had the lowest count with just 98 listings in Lagos. These homes generally include three bedrooms, four bathrooms, and four toilets, with an average price of about ₦57 million.

## Observations Worth Noting
Location is king. Price anomalies exist where small properties in premium locations are priced higher than larger ones in suburban areas.
Lekki, Ikoyi (Lagos), and Maitama (Abuja) are prime real estate zones.
Detached duplexes are consistently linked to higher prices, regardless of location.
There’s a visible price disparity between Lagos/Abuja and the rest of Nigeria, emphasizing economic concentration.

## Strategic Recommendations
Based on the analysis, here are my recommendations:

I recommend focusing real estate investments in Lekki, Ikoyi, and Maitama, where demand and pricing justify premium developments.
I recommend developers diversify offerings by listing more budget-friendly units in Ajah and similar high-volume areas to attract mid-market buyers.
I recommend standardizing property feature reporting (especially bedrooms and parking) across platforms to enable clearer comparisons for buyers and analysts.
I recommend building dashboards with location-based filters (state and town) so stakeholders can drill down to their regions of interest.
I recommend quarterly monitoring of pricing and listing frequency, particularly in Lagos and Abuja. Price regulation or consumer protection policies may be necessary as the gap between these and other regions continues to widen.
I recommend leveraging these insights to drive data-backed conversations in housing affordability, urban planning, and real estate investment forums.

## Project Output
